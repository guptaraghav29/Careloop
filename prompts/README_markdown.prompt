# Requirements
1. Functionality: The file must contain a top-level heading and a brief descriptive subtitle.
2. Format: The content must be formatted using Markdown syntax.
3. Clarity: The project name "PDD-Hackathon" must be prominent.
4. Consistency: Ensure the text accurately reflects the purpose of the repository as a Hackathon project.

# Instructions
1. Create a Markdown file that starts with a level-1 header (#) containing the text "PDD-Hackathon".
2. Immediately follow the header with a single line of text describing the project as "PDD Hackathon Project".
3. Ensure there are no extra code blocks or unnecessary boilerplate; the output should be clean Markdown.

# Deliverables
- A `README.md` file containing the project title and description.
